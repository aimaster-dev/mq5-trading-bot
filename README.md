3. **Trade Execution**:
   - Uses market orders with TP/SL based on user input.
   - Multiple TP levels allow scaling out positions.

4. **Controls**:

## ðŸ“Š Panel Layout

- Timeframe (`TF`)
- Lot Size
- Stop Loss
- Take Profits (TP1â€“TP5)

- Trade/Close buttons

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- Currently, only **bearish crossovers** (SMA above EMA) trigger trades. You can expand `IsCrossover()` to handle bullish entries.
- Multi-TP logic uses separate market orders for each target.
- Indicator handle errors and buffer copying are validated with `Print` debug logs.

---

## âœ… To-Do

- [ ] Add bullish crossover support
- [ ] Improve UI spacing and layout
- [ ] Add trailing stop or break-even logic
- [ ] Implement risk-based lot sizing
- [ ] Add trade history logging to file
